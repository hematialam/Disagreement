Found 50 hits for: [sentNum: 370]In conclusion, the ACS recommendations are made in the context of maximizing reductions in breast cancer mortality and reducing years of life lost while minimizing the associated harms among the population of women in the United States. 
1.  1.9126776	[sentNum: 125]Although annual screening was an efficient strategy for reducing breast cancer mortality and increasing life years gained, it was noted by the authors to be more resource intensive (24).
2.  1.5987222	[sentNum: 89]This difference in number needed to invite for screening to prevent one death was a key reason the United States Preventive Services Task Force elected not to recommend routine screening for women aged 40–49 years, despite similar mortality reductions (23).
3.  1.595725	[sentNum: 206]However, the United States Preventive Services Task Force arrived at a different conclusion regarding routine screening for women aged 40–49 years by placing greater weight on the lower prevalence of disease in this population, which reduces the positive predictive value of mammography and increases the number needed to screen to prevent one breast cancer-related death. 
4.  1.5466311	[sentNum: 211]This is of particular importance because each year in the United States breast cancer is diagnosed in approximately 50,000 women younger than 50 years.
5.  1.5129318	[sentNum: 83]Despite some study limitations (all studies were rated of “fair” quality by the United States Preventive Services Task Force), this review reaffirmed a reduction in breast cancer-related mortality for women aged 39–69 years who were invited for screening. 
6.  1.4607133	[sentNum: 299]Medical comorbidity and life expectancy should be considered in a breast cancer screening program for women aged 75 years or older because the benefit of screening mammography decreases compared with the harms of overtreatment with advancing age. 
7.  1.448775	[sentNum: 85]Relative risk of breast cancer mortality in women invited for screening was 0.85 for women aged 39–49 years; 0.86 for women aged 50–59 years; and 0.68 for women aged 60–69 years. 
8.  1.4258444	[sentNum: 7]Breast cancer mortality can be effectively reduced through screening. 
9.  1.3522242	[sentNum: 207]In addition, the United States Preventive Services Task Force argues that all women who participate in breast cancer screening may potentially experience a false-positive mammogram (as high as 49% of women after 10 years of screening), with resultant additional imaging, biopsies, and psychologic distress (44).

1.  1.8790426	[sentNum: 204]Although routine screening in women aged 40–49 years was not recommended, the Task Force advised that screening in women younger than 50 years should be individualized based on “patient values regarding specific benefits and harms” (23).

5.  1.4196405	[sentNum: 215]However, these models demonstrate a greater reduction in mortality and increased number of life years gained by screening annually; therefore, accepting a biennial strategy reduces some (19%) of the potential benefits of screening.
6.  1.3422024	[sentNum: 198]Some average-risk women may prefer biennial screening, which maintains most of the benefits of screening while minimizing both the frequency of screening and the potential for additional testing, whereas other women prefer annual screening because it maximizes cancer detection.
7.  1.2676606	[sentNum: 299]Medical comorbidity and life expectancy should be considered in a breast cancer screening program for women aged 75 years or older because the benefit of screening mammography decreases compared with the harms of overtreatment with advancing age. 
8.  1.2471032	[sentNum: 213]This decision was based on the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network screening models, which predicted that 81% of the benefits of screening (ie, mortality reduction) could be maintained by screening every other year (24).

Found 50 hits for: [sentNum: 372]The intention of this new guideline is to provide both guidance and flexibility for women about when to start and stop screening mammography and how frequently to be screened for breast cancer.
1.  1.8038933	[sentNum: 192]When should mammography begin, and how frequently should mammography be performed?
2.  1.3986971	[sentNum: 8]The purpose of this Practice Bulletin is to review breast cancer screening guidelines and the evidence used to support the recommendations and highlight new screening modalities and controversies surrounding screening.
3.  1.15676	[sentNum: 187]Multiple reviews have supported the combination of clinical breast examination and mammography for breast cancer screening (36–41). 
4.  1.155667	[sentNum: 168]New cases of cancer can arise during screening intervals, and breast self-awareness may prompt women not to delay in reporting breast changes based on false reassurance of recent negative screening result. 
5.  1.1420168	[sentNum: 179]Because other screening methods (mammography and clinical breast examination) can have false-negative results and cases of breast cancer can occur in unscreened women, there are clearly situations in which women will detect cancer themselves. 
6.  1.0452577	[sentNum: 32]Breast cancer accounts for 27% of all new cases of cancer diagnosed in women (2). 
7.  1.036824	[sentNum: 37]Breast cancer-related mortality has been decreasing steadily since 1990, reflecting both earlier detection of breast cancer and improved treatment (3).

9.  0.98442125	[sentNum: 299]Medical comorbidity and life expectancy should be considered in a breast cancer screening program for women aged 75 years or older because the benefit of screening mammography decreases compared with the harms of overtreatment with advancing age. 
10.  0.91359293	[sentNum: 217]Potential adverse outcomes of breast cancer screening mammography include false-positive mammograms, false-negative mammograms, and overdiagnosis.
