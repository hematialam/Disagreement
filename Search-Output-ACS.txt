11. 0 0.5056058	[sentNum: 246]Although overall the sensitivity of digital and screen-film mammography is similar, digital mammography is more sensitive in younger women and women with mammographically dense breasts.75No
12. 0 0.48745373	[sentNum: 289]Further, most breast screening studies did not provide estimates of benefits and harms over a lifetime horizon, which is important when considering policies that will span several decades or more of an individual&#x2019;s lifetime. No
13. 0 0.48572937	[sentNum: 217]66,67 For the age group that tends to be most controversial (i.e., ages 40&#x2013;49), Hellquist et al compared breast cancer mortality rates in Swedish women living in counties that invited women in their 40s to screening with breast cancer mortality rates among women living in counties that did not invite women in their 40s to screening.68No
14. 0 0.47584328	[sentNum: 238]69 The exemplar model did not explore a hybrid strategy that varied the screening interval by age.No
15. 0 0.45413637	[sentNum: 76]22 At that time, the ACS concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend for or against MRI screening for women in other categories of increased risk, but recommended against use of MRI screening in women with less than a 15% lifetime risk.22No
16. 0 0.43691772	[sentNum: 202]While a recent study has collected more contemporary health utility information on false positives among women in the United States,60 it did not explore the duration applicable to screening-related short-term reduction in health utilities, nor did it differentiate between women who underwent biopsy versus those who had repeat examinations. No
17. 0 0.43382266	[sentNum: 133]Qualified recommendations indicate there is clear evidence of benefit of screening but less certainty about the balance of benefits and harms, or about patients&#x2019; values and preferences, which could lead to different decisions about screening.12No
18. 0 0.42663774	[sentNum: 38]The GDG deliberations on the evidence and framing of the recommendations were guided by the GRADE domains: the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes, the diversity in women&#x2019;s values and preferences, and confidence in the magnitude of the effects on outcomes.12No
19. 0 0.42559564	[sentNum: 282]Given the absence of evidence of improved outcomes associated with self-examination, the 2003 ACS guideline did not include a recommendation for routine performance of or instruction in breast self-examination. No
20. 0 0.42402697	[sentNum: 307]Screen-film systems improved over time, and these mostly have been replaced by full-field digital mammography units, resulting in further improvements in imaging performance, particularly in younger women and women with mammographically dense breasts.75No
